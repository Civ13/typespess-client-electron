# Typepess Electron Client
Civ13's typespess [electron](https://electronjs.org) client.

Run the `setup` file to prepare all the folders and clone the dependencies. You will need command line git installed. If you don't, you can also do it manually through your git program - follow the steps on the file.

When you're ready to compile, run the `compile` file.

Currently supports Linux and Windows. Might work on MacOS, but you will have to run `electron-packager` manually.
